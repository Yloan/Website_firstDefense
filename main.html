                    Blitzkrieg is a multiplayer arena fighting game designed for fast, strategic, and accessible matches. 
                    Players build a team of three characters with unique abilities and face off against other players or AIs on various maps. 
                    The pixel art style gives the game a retro and nostalgic look, while the gameplay focuses on strategy and real-time action. 
                    The game targets players aged 12 to 25 looking for a fun, dynamic, and easy-to-learn experience, solo or with friends.

                    Statuses are temporary effects applied to characters (burn, oil, freeze, etc.) that change their behavior or abilities. 
                    The originality of the game lies in the synergy between these statuses: 
                    some combined effects trigger special reactions, 
                    such as an explosion if a burning enemy is also covered in oil. 
                    Players must exploit these interactions to gain the upper hand and control the battlefield.

            <section class="subsection">
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Before each match, every player builds their team by choosing three characters from a diverse selection. Each character has their own stats, resistances, and abilities. 
                    Team composition is crucial: you must balance offense, defense, and status synergies to maximize your chances of victory.

                    The game offers 18 playable characters, each with unique styles, abilities, and strategies. 
                    Some are specialized in direct attacks, others in support or area control. 
                    This diversity allows every player to find a style that suits them and to experiment with different combinations.

                When launching the game, the player accesses an intuitive menu to set up the match: choose the mode (local or online), number of players and AIs, select characters and the map. 
                In-game, each player controls one active character but can switch at any time with one of their two backups. 
                Battles are paced by the use of abilities with cooldowns, the application of statuses, and strategic team management. 
                The last player with at least one character alive wins the match.
